**Inference**
1. Adaptations to cold temperatures have high metabolic costs. It is expensive, in terms of energy use, for land plants and animals to withstand very cold temperatures, and it gets more expensive the colder it gets, which means that the lower the air temperature, the fewer species have evolved to survive it. This factor, in conjunction with the decline in air temperature with increasing elevation, explains the distribution of species diversity in mountain ecosystems: you find fewer species high up a mountain than at the mountain's base because ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?
2. You find fewer species high up a mountain than at the mountain's base because ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?
3. Most mammals sleep for several hours each day. Scientists have found that during sleep, the brain clears out toxins that accumulate during waking hours. Therefore, sleep deprivation in mammals likely ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?
4. Studies show that plants grown in soil with mycorrhizal fungi have better access to nutrients and water. Farmers who use these beneficial fungi report higher crop yields. This suggests that agricultural productivity ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?

7. Urban areas typically have higher concentrations of air pollutants than rural areas due to increased industrial activity and vehicle emissions. Studies have linked air pollution to respiratory problems in humans. Therefore, people living in urban environments are more likely to ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?
8. Honeybees play a crucial role in pollinating many food crops. Recent studies have documented significant declines in honeybee populations due to pesticide use and habitat loss. This trend suggests that food production may ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?
9. Social media algorithms are designed to show users content similar to what they have previously engaged with. This creates information bubbles where people primarily see viewpoints that align with their existing beliefs. As a result, social media users may become ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?
10. Archaeological evidence shows that early human settlements were typically located near reliable water sources such as rivers and lakes. Water was essential for drinking, agriculture, and transportation. This pattern indicates that ancient civilizations developed ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?
11. Neuroscientists have discovered that the human brain continues to form new neural connections throughout life, a process called neuroplasticity. This capacity is enhanced by novel experiences and learning new skills. Research shows that individuals who regularly engage in intellectually challenging activities maintain higher cognitive function as they age. Therefore, lifelong learning programs for seniors would likely ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?
12. Economists have observed that countries with higher levels of income inequality tend to have lower rates of social mobility. When wealth is concentrated among a small elite, fewer resources are available for public education and social programs that help individuals improve their economic status. This pattern suggests that societies seeking to increase social mobility should ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?
13. Climate scientists have noted that as global temperatures rise, many species are shifting their geographic ranges toward the poles. This migration occurs because organisms must remain within their optimal temperature ranges to survive and reproduce. However, some species with limited mobility or specific habitat requirements cannot easily relocate. These findings indicate that climate change will most likely ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?
14. Psychologists studying decision-making have found that people tend to overestimate their ability to control outcomes and underestimate the role of chance in their successes. This cognitive bias, known as the illusion of control, can lead to overconfidence in risky situations. Understanding this bias suggests that effective risk management strategies should ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?
15. Medical researchers have discovered that chronic inflammation in the body is linked to numerous diseases including heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. They have also found that regular moderate exercise reduces inflammatory markers in the blood. Additionally, diets rich in omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants have anti-inflammatory effects. These findings suggest that preventing chronic diseases may be best achieved by ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?
16. Linguists studying language acquisition have observed that children exposed to multiple languages from birth develop enhanced cognitive flexibility and problem-solving skills compared to monolingual children. This advantage appears to result from the constant mental exercise of switching between different linguistic systems. These research findings suggest that educational policies promoting multilingual education would likely ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?
17. Behavioral economists have documented that people are generally loss-averse, meaning they feel the pain of losing something more intensely than the pleasure of gaining something of equal value. This psychological principle explains why consumers are often reluctant to switch from familiar products to potentially superior alternatives. Marketing strategies that acknowledge this tendency would most effectively ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?
18. Ecologists studying forest ecosystems have found that old-growth forests store significantly more carbon than younger forests or plantations. These mature forests also support greater biodiversity and provide more stable watershed protection. However, old-growth forests take centuries to develop and are vulnerable to logging and development. Conservation efforts focused on climate change mitigation should therefore ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?
19. Sociologists have observed that societies with strong social safety nets tend to have higher levels of entrepreneurship and innovation.

This relationship suggests that government investment in social programs may ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?
20. Astronomers studying exoplanets have discovered that rocky planets in the "habitable zone" around their stars are more likely to retain atmospheres and liquid water if they have strong magnetic fields. Earth's magnetic field protects our atmosphere from being stripped away by solar wind. Planets without magnetic fields, even those at appropriate distances from their stars, tend to lose their atmospheres over time. This knowledge indicates that the search for life beyond Earth should focus on planets that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?
